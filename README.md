Can you take a look at these refinements? We need the following tweaks — the current behavior isn't matching the intended design direction:

1. "Clear Blur" Visual Pass
Current: Feature cards and dropdowns are using bg-slate-900/80 but the backdrop-blur seems to be stripped or ineffective.

Expected:

Use a crisp, translucent "clear blur" look — meaning bg-slate-900/80 with backdrop-blur-sm or backdrop-blur-md.

The goal is that content behind the card is visible but defocused, simulating frosted glass (not just opacity).

Please double-check the layering (z-index, stacking context) and ensure backdrop-filter isn’t being blocked by parent containers.

2. Top Nav Hover Behavior
Issue: Hovering over top nav items is triggering full-width dropdowns/cards — only the Features card should do this on click.

Expected:

Keep hover state for nav items minimal: show only a tagline and a "Try Now" button — no card render unless it's Features and clicked.

This ensures less visual clutter and avoids pushing content downward unintentionally.

3. Pricing Tab Hover: Symmetric CTA
Expected Behavior:

On hover, pricing tab should show a centered CTA like “Free during Beta” in a clean, symmetric layout.

The design should not shift or expand vertically on hover — just a simple badge or tagline revealed inline with the nav item.

Let me know if any layout constraints (like flex/grid alignment or overflow handling) are affecting these behaviors. If Tailwind config overrides or conflicting classes are involved, happy to jump on a call to debug.

Thanks!
